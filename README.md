# Caps/Num Lock Indicator

Displays a tray icon that shows whether the Caps Lock and/or Num Lock state is active.

```
Lowercase a = Caps Lock is off.
Uppercase A = Caps Lock is on.
Dark background = Num Lock is off.
Blue background = Num Lock is on.
```

## Motivation

My laptop doesn't have software OSD for keyboard states, nor any keyboard indicator lights.
